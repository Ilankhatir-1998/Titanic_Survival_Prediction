# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

## _Overview of problem statement_
  This is the legendary Titanic ML activity – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML activity and familiarize yourself with data science.The activity is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using the available dataset.

### _Motivation behind problem_
**_The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history_**
  
  On April 15, 1912, during her **maiden voyage**, the widely considered “unsinkable” **RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg**. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, **resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew**.

_While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others._

In this activity, we will be building a predictive model that answers the question: 
        **“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger datasheet (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).**
        
## _Dataset Penetration_
  In this activity, we'll gain access to two similar datasets driven by the passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled "train.csv" and the other is titled "test.csv".

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”. By having that list of data we will train our model.

The "test.csv" dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s our task to predict these outcomes.
Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived. The prediction will be based on details driven from train.csv file.
