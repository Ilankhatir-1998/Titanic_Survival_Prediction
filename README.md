# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

## _Overview of problem statement_
  This is the legendary Titanic ML activity – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML activity and familiarize yourself with data science.The activity is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using the available dataset.

### _Motivation behind problem_
**_The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history_**
  
  On April 15, 1912, during her **maiden voyage**, the widely considered “unsinkable” **RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg**. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, **resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew**.

_While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others._

In this activity, we will be building a predictive model that answers the question: 
        **“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger datasheet (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).**

Use ```for``` loop
  ```Python3
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("train/dataset.csv")
   ```
